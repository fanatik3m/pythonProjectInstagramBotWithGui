# pythonProjectInstagramBotWithGui

Hi user or developer! This is my project that can login in instagram.com and set likes to different posts

To use it you need:
+ Install selenium and selenium webdriver
+ Install PyQt6
+ Write data of account (which will be used) in config.py
+ Create folder with name 'cookies' in project location

# To run program you need to run 'GUI.py'

### ToDo: add multiprocessing and GUI to the project
+ In this program you can choose use muluiprocessing or don't use
+ In some pc's with multiprocessing will be faster
+ But in some pc's without multiprocessing will be faster
+ I advise you to try both of these and choose which is faster and use it
(I added a time counter to more comfortable deciding)
